        <h2>Tunnel 3</h2>
    <p1> You go down the third tunnel, toward the rushing water. <br>
        You are faced with a large current that flowed through the cave. <br>
        You then proceed to jump into the water, <br> hoping the current will lead somewhere out of the ground. <br>
        And fortunately, it does. You are outside and alive.<br>
        You win! <br>
